# SellerFeeCalculator
## Description
A simple web application to calculate the profit expected from the sale of an item on Grailed, Depop or Bump after fees are deducted (including PayPal fees).
## Roadmap
In addition to improving the UI using a framework for ease of use, this web application will be used for other platforms for sellers (e.g. eBay).
